Do this every time you finish a valuable chunk of work, probably many times a day.
Commit these changes to your local repo. How? Click the “Git” tab 
Check “Staged” box for any files whose existence or modifications you want to commit.
To see what’s changed in file since the last commit, click on “Diff” for a Git pop-up
If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”
Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”. Click “Commit”
